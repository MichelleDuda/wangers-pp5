## Marketing Strategies

### Pre-strategy planning

Wangers is a B2C restaurant concept specializing in freshly prepared, high-quality chicken wings, available for both pickup and delivery within a defined local radius. Rooted in flavor, convenience, and community, the brand is designed to meet the cravings of a diverse local customer base.

To lay the groundwork for our marketing strategy, we first identified where our audience spends time online. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok are ideal for connecting with younger, food-loving users who engage with visual and short-form content. Meanwhile, Facebook provides an effective space for sharing promotions, event updates, and building a broader local presence.

Understanding our customers' needs is key. They’re looking for convenient, crave-worthy meals—perfect for group get-togethers, game nights, or comfort food moments. Content that taps into this—such as behind-the-scenes kitchen clips, flavor reveals, and time-sensitive promotions—can help us meet that demand. Weekly features, short videos, interactive polls, and regular updates via email and social platforms will ensure we stay top-of-mind.

Promotions will be central to customer engagement. Wangers plans to roll out loyalty rewards, bundle offers, and special deals like “Wing Wednesday” or “Buy 10 Get 5 Free.” These types of offers are best delivered through channels where our audience is most active—namely Instagram Stories, Facebook posts, and weekly emails.

Our broader goal is to become the area's go-to destination for wings by combining bold flavors with seamless service. To achieve this, we’ll focus on building brand loyalty through consistent storytelling, active local engagement, and a frictionless ordering process.

Initially, Wangers will rely on organic and low-cost marketing tactics, such as social media content, email campaigns, local collaborations, and community outreach. Once we’ve gained traction, we’ll explore paid advertising options, including Instagram promotions and Google Local Ads, to further expand our reach.

### Social Media Marketing - Mock FB page

The Facebook page complements the website by showcasing new sauces, promoting special offers, and sharing timely updates. It provides customers with opportunities to engage directly—through comments or messages—helping them build a stronger connection with the brand. Overall, the Facebook presence adds an interactive dimension to the business, making it more approachable and personable.

Additionally, the Facebook page can serve as a foundation for expanding onto other platforms like Instagram or Twitter. With the help of content automation tools such as Buffer, Hootsuite, or Later, managing multiple social channels can be streamlined without adding extra workload.

### Location specific online presence - Google My Business

Wangers will register with Google My Business to appear in local map searches (“wings near me”, “hot wings open now”), along with accurate hours, photos, and reviews.

We’ll also explore adding Wangers to local food apps and directories for extended visibility—especially during peak times like weekends and major sports events.
